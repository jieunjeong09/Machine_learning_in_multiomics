This project focuses on data science techniques for analyzing multi-omics data. We concentrate on one type of dimension reduction and two types of machine learning.

The .Rmd file contains code chunks that can be easily adapted to other datasets. The accompanying .pdf file is the rendered result of that document, and the .zip file contains the input data used in the analysis.
